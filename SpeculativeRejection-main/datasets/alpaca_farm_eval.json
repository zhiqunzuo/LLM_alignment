For example, African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles but have distinct cultural identities. While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, \u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.\u201d This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\""
