The implementation: In an app for an online fast fashion e-commerce platform, the user uploads a video in which the whole body of the user is within frame and the user turns 360 degree. Using the data from the video, the app reconstructs a 3d avatar which is shaped accurately by the measurements of the user. The avatar has almost the same face and hairstyle as the user. In the app there are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs). Similar items from different fashion brands are suggested to the user based on their previous choice of fashion items."
